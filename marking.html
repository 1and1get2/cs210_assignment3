      COMPSCI 210: Assignment #3 - Marking Guidelines
   </h2>
   <p>
      As specified in the assignment specification, we will be marking the assignment
      automatically (or semi-automatically).
   </p>
   <p>
      We have provided you with a copy of our marking script <a href="markMe.sh">markMe.sh</a>
      which you will be able to execute on <span class="code">login.cs.auckland.ac.nz</span>.
      Please test your assignment thoroughly and run through the marking script before
      submission.
   </p>
   <p>
      The marking script is a shell script (akin to a BAT file on a DOS system, but far
      more advanced). Shell scripting allows familiar programming constructs (such as
      for loops and if blocks) albeit the syntax can be a little rough when you look at
      it first.
   </p>
   <p>
      The first line of the script starts with a hash-bang-slash: the slash-bin slash-sh
      part tells the operating system that it is the program <span class="code">/bin/sh</span>that
      is going to run (i.e. interpret) this file. You can execute any commands (i.e. applications),
      user-defined or system-supplied, within a shell script. Part of the exercise in
      this assignment is to study the shell script and see what it is doing.
   </p>
   <p>
      The main idea behind automatic marking is that if there is no difference between
      the outputs of the reference solution (i.e. the supplied sample solution) and your
      solution for the same set of inputs, then your solution is deemed similar to the
      reference solution, and thus you get full marks for the part that is tested.
   </p>
   <p>
      Note that there will be no partial marks for any sub-part, so it is important that
      you get right as many parts as you possibly can.
   </p>
   <p>
      Here is a rough outline of how you will set up the test environment.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>Make a directory called <span class="code">Assignment3</span> somewhere suitable.</li>
      <li>Copy the script <span class="code">markMe.sh</span> to this directory.</li>
      <li>Make the script executable: <span class="code">chmod +x markMe.sh</span></li>
      <li>Copy the sample solution provided to you: a3ss.s to this directory as well.
      </li>
      <li>Make a sub-directory called <span class="code">a3</span> and copy your solution
         files there.</li>
      <li>Go to the top-level directory <span class="code">Assignment3</span> and run the
         script by issuing the command <span class="code">./markMe.sh</span>.
   </ol>
   <p>
      Here's a sample session of testing:
   </p>
   <pre>
sman063@login01%  mkdir Assignment3
sman063@login01%  cd Assignment3/
sman063@login01%  cp ../markMe.sh .
sman063@login01%  chmod +x markMe.sh 
sman063@login01%  cp ../SampleSolution/a3ss.s .
sman063@login01%  mkdir a3
sman063@login01%  cp ../SampleSolution/main.cpp a3
sman063@login01%  ./markMe.sh 
Deduct 5 marks if compiler warnings exist
Checking Solution ------------- Total 10 marks
No news is good news

Checking Solution ------------- Total 30 marks
No news is good news

Checking Solution ------------- Total 60 marks
No news is good news

sman063@login01%  
</pre>
   <p>
      Note that we will not use the same inputs supplied in the marking script when we
      are marking (<a href="bogus.cpp">why shouldn't we?</a>), so it is important that
      you test your solutions extensively and validate your results before attempting
      to check your solutions using the marking script.
